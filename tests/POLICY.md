# The pomata test policy

This document is the method of record for how pomata is tested. It exists to end a specific failure mode: an edge case
is handled or tested one way in one function and another way in its neighbour, a fix lands for that one function, and
the same class of difference persists in the function next door. That drift is not a shortage of effort -- it is the
absence of a *method*. The method is this:

> **We believe the registry and test everything uniformly. Where a function's edge-case logic genuinely differs -- and
> it will, because a rolling mean, an EMA, and a reducing ratio cannot treat a `null` identically -- we make that
> difference an explicit, documented variant, declared in one typed field. A function may depart from the baseline
> only by *declaring* it. Never by drift.**

The single source of truth is [`tests/support/registry.py`](support/registry.py): one typed `FunctionProfile` row per
public function. The shared contract suite reads each row and tests each function *by its own declared rules*, so the
whole package is exercised from one place and every genuine difference is stated, not scattered. The registry is kept
honest by [`tests/test_registry.py`](test_registry.py): a function that behaves differently from the profile it
declares -- or is added without a row -- is a red build.

## 1. The precision floor: test the math, not the hardware

pomata proves numerical correctness to a **principled, conditioning-derived tolerance**, and **not one digit tighter**.
The tolerances are named constants in [`tests/support/tolerances.py`](support/tolerances.py); that module is the single
source of truth for "how close is close enough", and no test may assert closer than the tier it belongs to.

| tier | relative | used for |
|------|----------|----------|
| `EXACT` | `1e-12` | a golden master on a fixed, deterministic series |
| `REFERENCE` | `1e-10` | agreement with the independent oracle |
| `PROPERTY` | `1e-10` | agreement under random (fuzzed) input |
| `SCALE` | `1e-6` | a rescaling test, where the rescale itself amplifies rounding |
| `STREAMING` | `1e-3` (abs) | a sequential recursion against a two-pass reference |

plus the conditioning floors `CONDITIONING_FLOOR`, `STANDARDIZED_MOMENT_FLOOR`, and `SUBNORMAL_FLOOR` for outputs that
cancel toward zero or approach the subnormal range.

**The rule.** A difference below the floor is hardware, not pomata, and we do not test it:

- **No bit-exact / sub-ULP / `== 0.0` assertion on fuzzed or cross-platform inputs.** A sub-ULP result depends on the
  CPU (x86 vs arm64), FMA contraction, the Polars version, and the order the query optimizer chooses -- none of which
  pomata owns. Asserting it is a test *designed* to flake across the CI matrix (this is the exact shape of the CDaR
  knife-edge flake that once churned a full cycle before it was pinned down).
- **Golden masters are rounded** (`.round(n)`) to a sane precision, so a frozen value never flakes between macOS-arm64,
  ubuntu-x86, and windows.
- **A magnitude-dependent band is sized to the data** (`input_scale ** degree * factor`), never fixed, so it is right
  at every scale; where a statistic legitimately needs a looser band (a square root that amplifies near zero, a
  difference of large terms that cancels), the departure carries a one-line reason.

The floor is not a compromise on rigor. It *is* the rigor: it draws the line exactly where "a difference means a real
coding error" ends and "a difference means IEEE-754 being IEEE-754" begins, and holds every function to the same line.

## 2. The taxonomy: the axes that decide a function's obligations

A function's edge-case obligations are fixed by *where it sits on a few axes*, not by which file it lives in. Same
coordinates → same tests, same names, same order. The axes are the fields of `FunctionProfile`:

- **macro** — `indicators` · `pnl` · `metrics`.
- **shape** — `REDUCING` (series → one scalar) · `ELEMENTWISE` (series → series) · `STRUCT` (a multi-line output).
- **domain** / **columns** — `SINGLE` · `PAIRED` (returns + benchmark) · `OHLCV` (with the column subset) · `EQUITY`.
- **windowed** — whether it takes a lookback `window`.
- **null_policy** / **nan_policy** — how an interior `null` / `NaN` flows (defined crisply in §3).
- **oracle** — the independent `*_reference` it is checked against, or `None` (component-definition / golden only).

A function's **scale** behaviour — its rescaling homogeneity — is deliberately *not* a registry field. Its degree is
per-input and family-specific (a variance is degree-2; a VWAP is degree-1 in price and degree-0 in volume; a borrow cost
is degree-1 in quantity; a return is invariant), so a single typed value cannot state it without being lossy or awkward.
The scale tests therefore stay in each function's own file, and only the one durably-enforceable dimension — the rung
**name** — is held uniform, by the grammar guard in [`tests/test_scale_grammar.py`](test_scale_grammar.py) (§6). Order,
docstring, and the shared assertion are normalized by convention (§4), not machine-checked, because a per-file rung has
no single place to enforce them from.

## 3. The null and NaN policies, defined crisply

This is the heart of the "explicit variant" idea: a `null` cannot mean the same thing to a pointwise transform, a
rolling window, a recursion, and a reduction, so each **declares** which it is. The shared contract then asserts the
matching behaviour, and the self-check proves the declaration is true of the code.

**`null_policy` — an interior `null` in the input:**

- **`SKIPPED`** *(reducing only)* — the `null` is dropped from the reduction; the scalar is exactly what it would be if
  the `null` were absent. *e.g. `sharpe_ratio`, `value_at_risk`.*
- **`PROPAGATES`** *(elementwise)* — the `null` nulls at most its own output row (and a fixed lag); the output recovers
  immediately after. A pointwise map. *e.g. `price_average`, `mom`, `returns_simple`.*
- **`IN_WINDOW_IS_NULL`** *(elementwise)* — a single `null` nulls **every rolling window that overlaps it** — about
  `window` rows — then the output recovers. *e.g. `sma`, `rsi_stochastic`, `value_at_risk_rolling`.*
- **`BRIDGED`** *(elementwise)* — a **recursion steps over** the `null`: its state carries across the gap, so later
  rows recover to the value they would have had. Identifiable because the same function **latches** a `NaN` (§ pairing
  below). *e.g. `ema`, `rma`, `atr`, `dema`.*
- **`LATCHES`** *(elementwise)* — the `null` contaminates every subsequent row and **never** recovers. *e.g. the
  Ehlers/Hilbert cycle pipeline: `mama`, `sine_wave`, `dominant_cycle_period`.*

**`nan_policy` — an interior `NaN` in the input:**

- **`POISONS`** *(reducing)* — the scalar becomes `NaN` (a non-null `NaN` is never silently skipped).
- **`PROPAGATES`** *(elementwise)* — the `NaN` nans the rows it reaches, then the output recovers.
- **`LATCHES`** *(elementwise)* — a recursion carries the `NaN` forward forever; the output never recovers.

**The recursion pairing.** A function that *bridges* a `null` is exactly one whose recurrence carries state — which
means a `NaN` in that state corrupts every later step. So **`BRIDGED` null ⇔ `LATCHES` nan**; the self-check enforces
the pair. This is why the two policies are declared together: they are two views of the same fact ("this is a
recursion"), and stating both makes the recursion explicit at the row rather than buried in the kernel.

## 4. The canonical ladder: one name, one order, one docstring per rung

Every test file lays its tests out in the same four tiers, in this order; within a tier the rungs are fixed and appear
only where the axes say they apply.

- **Contract** — `returns_expr` → `reduces_to_scalar` | `preserves_length` | `emits_struct` → `lazy_eager_parity`
  → `over_partitions_independently`.
- **Edge** — `<param>_out_of_range_raises` (per validated parameter, in signature order) → `empty` → `single_row`
  → `all_null` → `nan_<policy>` → `null_<policy>` → *(windowed:)* `warmup_null_count` → `window_exceeds_length`
  → `window_equals_length` → `window_one_*` → `constant_window_is_nan` → *(singularity guards)*.
- **Correctness** — `matches_reference` → `golden_master`.
- **Properties** — `matches_reference_for_any_input` → `matches_reference_under_missing_data`
  → `scale_homogeneity` | `scale_invariance` → `matches_reference_at_large_magnitude`. The scale rung is spelled from one
  vocabulary: `scale_homogeneity` (degree ≥ 1) | `scale_invariance` (degree 0); for a per-input OHLCV function,
  `price_scale_*` and `volume_scale_*`; for a per-input pnl function, `scale_homogeneity_in_<role>` (`in_quantity` /
  `in_weight` / `in_each_input`); for an additive offset, `additive_shift_invariance`. `tests/test_scale_grammar.py`
  makes any other spelling a red build (§6).

**The naming law.** A rung has exactly **one** name across the whole suite. `single_row` is never also
`single_row_is_nan`; `window_one` is never also `window_one_is_identity`. The null/NaN flow anchor is spelled from one
**reserved** vocabulary — `null_skipped` · `null_propagates` · `null_in_window_is_null` · `null_bridged` ·
`null_latches`, and `nan_poisons` · `nan_propagates` · `nan_latches` — each usable **only** by a function that declares
that policy (a multi-input factory may still test a per-input case under a descriptive name such as
`null_in_volume_propagates`); `tests/test_policy_grammar.py` makes a canonical name that lies about its policy a red
build (§6). Test-local variables follow **`{WHO}_{QUALIFIER}`** — `group_primary` / `expected_primary`, not `values` /
`case` — so two files read the same top to bottom. A contributor opening two families side by side never has to hold
"which edge is tested how, where" in their head. They read the row and the rung.

## 5. The architecture: one copy, applied to all (and the explicit variant)

Each rung is placed by how much of it is shared:

- **Universal** — identical for every member (`returns_expr`, `lazy_eager_parity`, `empty`, `all_null`,
  `over_partitions`): one parametrized module per family over `__all__`; there is no per-file copy to drift.
- **Class-parametrized** — same structure, per-member expected value driven by the registry row (its oracle, shape,
  null/NaN policy, degree): `single_row`, `nan_<policy>`, `null_<policy>`, `scale_*`, `matches_reference*`. **This is
  where a genuine difference lives as an explicit variant** — `ema` declares `BRIDGED`, `sma` declares
  `IN_WINDOW_IS_NULL`, and the one contract tests each accordingly. Not two hand-written tests that might diverge; one
  contract and two declared rows.
- **Function-specific** — a truly unique golden or a bespoke singularity of *that* function: a single, explicitly
  named, documented test in that function's own file, in the same tiered class, in the same order. Explicit, never
  implicit.

## 6. How this is enforced (so parity holds by construction, not by vigilance)

Three source-only guards enforce this, on every run. `tests/test_registry.py` proves three things:

1. **bijection** — the registry is in exact bijection with the three public `__all__` tuples: no function without a
   row, no row without a function. A new public function fails the build until it is profiled.
2. **oracle integrity** — every declared `*_reference` oracle is importable.
3. **policy is real** — each function's *actual* `null` / `NaN` flow, observed on a well-conditioned series, matches
   the `shape` and policies it declares. Only the flow is read (which rows go null/NaN, and whether the effect
   recovers), never a value, so the check is exact and platform-stable.

`tests/test_scale_grammar.py` proves the fourth, for the one axis that stays per-file (§2):

4. **scale names are canonical** — parsing every test module's source, each scale-family rung it finds is drawn from
   the one vocabulary (§4) and sits in a `Test*Properties` class. A name like `test_price_homogeneity` /
   `test_volume_invariance` / `test_scale_behavior` that departs from that vocabulary is a red build.

And `tests/test_policy_grammar.py` proves the fifth, for the null/NaN value anchors that stay per-file (§2, §5):

5. **null/NaN names do not lie** — every use of a reserved canonical `test_null_*` / `test_nan_*` name (§4) is matched
   against the registry: a windowed or recursive factory can no longer call its null anchor `test_null_propagates` while
   declaring `IN_WINDOW_IS_NULL` or `BRIDGED`. Descriptive per-input names are left free; only the canonical ones are held.

The consequence: a function cannot silently drift from its declared behaviour, a new function cannot slip in untested,
and neither a scale rung nor a null/NaN anchor can be spelled a way that contradicts the registry. Parity is not
something to hunt for — the suite has already asserted it.
